# Genereater
A simple way to generate random recipes for inspiration!
You can replace the list contents with whatever you want(fabric, garment, time period,for example) to create never before conceived ideas.
I like to use it for inspiring new recipes or methods in the kitchen.
It works by measureing the length of the list you created, generating a set of random numbers, then using those numbers to index the lists and print them in a specific order. 
Style Ingredient Format
ChickenFried Turkey Cookie
Boiled Pasta Balls
Curdled Pork Sandwich

I didnt say it would be a _good_ idea
Have Fun!
